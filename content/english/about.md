## Where I am studying
I am currently attending Clovis Community College, where I am taking Bio-12. A genomic data science research class. By taking this course, I've had the opportunity to do some pretty interesting research about the Lefty genes using resources like Rstudio. I plan on continuing this research outside of this course. 
## Why I am interested
When choosing my major, I knew I loved science and that I wanted to dedicate my career to helping others. At first I thought the only route was through premed, but now I am considering entering the field of research.
## Exciting Projects
As mentioned, I previously worked on the Lefty genes. During this upcoming Summer, I am excited to look into other genes that interact with Lefty.
