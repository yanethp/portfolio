## Where I am studying
I am currently attending Clovis Community College to pursue a degree in Biology. Here, I was able to take Bio-12, a genomic data science research class. By taking this course, I have had the opportunity to research the Lefty genes using resources like R. I plan on continuing this research during my academic career here at CCC.
## Why I am interested
When choosing my major, I knew I loved science and that I wanted to dedicate my career to helping others. At first I thought the only route was through medicine, but now I am considering entering the field of research. After being introduced to CMOOR in my Bio-11A class, my interest in research has grown. However, I still have a love for medicine and hope to go into biomedical research.
## Exciting Projects
As mentioned, I previously worked on the Lefty genes during the Spring semester of 2022 and continued this research as a peer mentor in the Bio-12 Summer semester. I'm excited to see how I can further my knowledge of these genes as the Fall semester approaches.
